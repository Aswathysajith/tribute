        alt="image of Mohanlal" height="300"width="300" >
        <ul>
            <li>During his career, he has appeared in more than 352 feature films, 
                primarily in Malayalam cinema, and also in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu,
                 and Kannada films.Mohanlal was declared as the wrestling champion in Kerala in 1977–78.
                  He has won several accolades in the sport.
                   He was also selected for the National championship which was to be held at New Delhi.
                    But he missed it as he was called for an audition for his debut film 'Manjil Virinja Pookkal',
                     which was directed by Fazil. Thus, Mohanlal went on to become one of the best actors of India and did not pursue wrestling as a profession</li>
            <p>In 1978, when he was 18, he started acting with a minor comedic role in the unreleased film Thiranottam, before making his screen debut in 1980 as an antagonist in the romance film Manjil Virinja Pookkal.[3] His portrayal of Narendran, a sadistic husband, received recognition and the film developed a cult status in Malayalam cinema.[4][5] Subsequently, Mohanlal was cast as the antagonist in many films. His first positive role was in Padayottam (1982),
                 the first 70 mm film in Malayalam.[4] It was 1983's Aattakalasam that gave him stardom.
                 [6] In 1984 he starred in Poochakkoru Mookkuthi, a comedy film whose success triggered 
                 a trend and popularised the genre in the 1980s.[7][8] In an early critically acclaimed performance,
                  Mohanlal played an antihero in the I. V. Sasi-directed thriller Uyarangalil (1984).
                  [9] In the same year, he co-founded Casino Films,[a] a motion picture production company 
                  which later produced his popular comedies Gandhinagar 2nd Street (1986) and Nadodikkattu (1987</p>
        </ul>
        <h1>Early life</h1>
        <p>Mohanlal Viswanathan was born in the village of Elanthoor in the Pathanamthitta district, Kerala on 21 May 1960. He is the youngest child of Viswanathan Nair, a former bureaucrat and Law Secretary with the Kerala government, and Santhakumari.[21][22] He had an elder brother named Pyarelal (died in 2000, during a military exercise).[23] Mohanlal grew up in Mudavanmugal at his paternal home in Thiruvananthapuram. He studied at Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Thiruvananthapuram and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Mahatma Gandhi College, Thiruvananthapuram.[24][25] Mohanlal's first role was as a sixth grader for a stage play called Computer Boy, in which he played a ninety-year-old man.[26]

            During 1977 and 1978 he was the Kerala state wrestling champion.[27]</p>
            <h1>Film career</h1>
            <p>Mohanlal made his acting debut in 1978 with the film Thiranottam, which was produced and made by Mohanlal and his friends—Maniyanpilla Raju, Suresh Kumar, Unni, Priyadarshan, Ravi Kumar and a few others. Mohanlal played Kuttappan, a mentally disabled servant. Due to some issues with censorship, the film was not released on time. It took 25 years to release the film.[13]

                In 1980, Mohanlal was cast in the lead antagonist role in Manjil Virinja Pookkal – the directorial debut of Fazil. The film became a major success.[28] Mohanlal's friends had sent his application in response to an advertisement released by Navodaya Studio.[29] He auditioned for the role in front of a panel that included professional directors. Displeased with his appearance, two of them gave him poor marks, but Fazil and Jijo Appachan gave him 90 and 95 marks out of 100.[30] In an interview with Reader's Digest in 2004, Mohanlal said that his looks as a young man might have fit the villain's image.[31]
                
                By 1983, Mohanlal was credited in more than 25 feature films, most of them had him playing negative (villain) roles.[31] Films such as Ente Mohangal Poovaninju, Iniyengilum, Visa, Attakkalasham, Kaliyil Alpam Karyam, Ente Mamattukkuttiyammakku, Engane Nee Marakkum, Unaru and Sreekrishna Parunthu changed his image.[vague] Through Sasikumar's Ivide Thudangunnu, he became a successful hero with a "good heart". Mohanlal played his first comic lead role in an ensemble cast in the 1984 comedy Poochakkoru Mookkuthi, directed by Priyadarshan, as a young man in love with a girl whom he mistakenly believes to be rich.[32] It also marked the beginning of the Mohanlal-Priyadarshan duo, who as of 2016, have worked together in 44 films.[33]
                
                In 1985, he recorded a song for the film Onnanam Kunnil Oradi Kunnil.[32] Uyarangalil, Nokketha Doorathu Kannum Nattu, Boeing Boeing and Aram + Aram = Kinnaram were some of his films in this period.</p>
